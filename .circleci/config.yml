#checkout: This command fetches your source code over SSH to the configured path 
#(the working directory, by default).


#restore_cache: This command restores a previously saved cache.


#save_cache: This command generates and saves a cache of a file, multiple files,
#or folders. In our case, we save a cache of the installed Python packages obtained after running pip install â€¦.


#store_artifacts: This command stores logs, binaries, etc. so that
#they are accessible by the app in later runs.
